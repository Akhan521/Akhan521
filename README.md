## Hi there, I'm Aamir Khan👋🏼

I’m a **Computer Science B.S. + M.S. student at UC Riverside** interested in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI Agents, Generative AI, building thoughtful software, and engineering for good**. 

I enjoy exploring the intersection of **AI, engineering, and accessibility**, and I love turning my ideas into fun and impactful projects.


### 👨🏽‍🎓 About Me
- **Aspiring AI & ML Engineer**: I focus on building and learning with **AI & ML** (LLMs, Gen. AI, Multimodal AI, DL, RL, AI agents, etc.) 
- **Software Engineer**: I enjoy building **AI-driven apps, intelligent tools, and friendly user experiences**.  
- **Engineering for Good**: My goal is to create projects that are technically impressive while being **helpful and accessible to others**.  
- **Beyond Code**: I’m into **boba, reading, skating, building LEGO, going for coffee runs, and gaming**, which keep me curious and inspired.

### 🛠️ A Glimpse Into My Projects
- **[Snaption](https://github.com/Akhan521/Snaption)**  
  Explored **multi-modal ML** and built an **end-to-end image captioning system** with PyTorch to generate natural language descriptions of images. Trained on **Flickr8k (8K images)**, tackling hyperparameter tuning, overfitting prevention, and data augmentation strategies.  
  *View my demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Snaption?tab=readme-ov-file#-demo) and read about my project [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Snaption/blob/main/README.md).*
  
- **[Text2SQL LLaMA Analyst](https://github.com/Akhan521/Text2SQL-LLaMA-Analyst)**  
  Fine-tuned `LLaMA-2-7B` to translate natural language descriptions into structured, SQL queries using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques: **LoRA + 4-bit quantization**.  
  *Includes a zero-setup [Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ISQ9jpYCEMQQ6WSKRqF60p3ZIEsJuuFo?usp=sharing)*

- **[GPT From Scratch](https://github.com/Akhan521/GPT-From-Scratch)**  
  Implemented **multi-head self-attention, transformer blocks, and autoregressive decoding** entirely from scratch in PyTorch to truly understand how GPT models work.  
  *Test it out yourself [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pHiw6OKHFPuaUIHw2aJkLGNz1k-cHXLt?usp=sharing).*

- **[Pixelate](https://github.com/Akhan521/Pixelate)**  
  Developed a **colorblind-friendly pixel-art editor** with an AI assistant (`Pixi`), real-time **colorblind-friendly** filters, and an accessible, intuitive interface for artists.  
  *View our demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Pixelate?tab=readme-ov-file#-pixelate-in-action).*

- **[Reddit Crawler](https://github.com/Akhan521/Reddit-Crawler)**  
  Engineered a robust **Reddit crawler and search engine** that **scraped, cleaned, and enriched 500MB+** of
  real-time subreddit data with **multi-threading** support, improving crawl throughput by 4× via parallelization.  
  *View our demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Reddit-Crawler?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-demo).*

## Hi there, I'm Aamir Khan👋🏼

I’m a **Computer Science B.S. + M.S. student at UC Riverside**, expected to graduate in December 2026, interested in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI Agents, Generative AI, building thoughtful software, and engineering for good**.
> I'm currently seeking AI/ML internships for Summer 2026, so please feel free to reach out with any opportunities or advice on how I can grow with you!

My work touches upon the intersection of **AI, thoughtful software design + engineering, and accessibility**; I particularly love turning my ideas into fun and impactful projects to benefit others. I'm an AI Trainer with [Handshake AI](https://joinhandshake.com/fellowship-program/referral/?referralCode=EBF4D5) and an AI product tester with [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aamir-khan-aak521/overlay/1767041499624/single-media-viewer?type=LINK&profileId=ACoAADqdK7wBX-esz3UR1KyfoBLx0KY4uax57fI&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BRzoEtx7JQveXsxVW6YEORA%3D%3D), where I focus on improving AI education through thoughtful course design and project experiences. I also spend my weekends teaching as an Islamic Studies Instructor at [Institute of Knowledge (IOK)](https://instituteofknowledge.com/), where I love cultivating a supportive and growth-driven learning environment for my students around Islam and what it means to live life as a Muslim in peace.

Here are a few AI courses I've directly contributed to and helped launch with DeepLearning.AI:
1. [Multi-AI Agent Systems with crewAI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/)
2. [Long-Term Agentic Memory with LangGraph](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/long-term-agentic-memory-with-langgraph/) 
3. [Semantic Caching for AI Agents with Redis](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/semantic-caching-for-ai-agents/)
4. [Jupyter-AI Coding in Notebooks](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/jupyter-ai-coding-in-notebooks/lesson/5330udp0/introduction)


### 👨🏽‍🎓 About Me
- **Aspiring AI/ML Engineer**: I focus on building and learning with **AI & ML** (LLMs, Gen. AI, Multimodal AI, DL, RL, AI agents, etc.)
- **Software Engineer**: I enjoy building **full-stack apps, intelligent tools, and friendly user experiences**.  
- **Engineering for Good**: My goal is to create projects that are technically impressive while being **helpful and accessible to others**.  
- **Beyond Code**: I’m obsessed with **boba, reading, skating, building LEGO, going for coffee runs, and gaming**, which keep me curious and inspired.

### 🛠️ A Glimpse Into My Projects
- **[Snaption](https://github.com/Akhan521/Snaption)**  
  Explored **multi-modal ML** and built an **end-to-end image captioning system** with PyTorch to generate natural language descriptions of images. Trained on **Flickr8k (8K images)**, tackling hyperparameter tuning, overfitting prevention, and data augmentation strategies.  
  *View my demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Snaption?tab=readme-ov-file#-demo) and read about my project [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Snaption/blob/main/README.md).*
  
- **[Text2SQL LLaMA Analyst](https://github.com/Akhan521/Text2SQL-LLaMA-Analyst)**  
  Fine-tuned `LLaMA-2-7B` to translate natural language descriptions into structured, SQL queries using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques: **LoRA + 4-bit quantization**.  
  *Includes a zero-setup [Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ISQ9jpYCEMQQ6WSKRqF60p3ZIEsJuuFo?usp=sharing)*

- **[GPT From Scratch](https://github.com/Akhan521/GPT-From-Scratch)**  
  Implemented **multi-head self-attention, transformer blocks, and autoregressive decoding** entirely from scratch in PyTorch to truly understand how GPT models work.  
  *Test it out yourself [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pHiw6OKHFPuaUIHw2aJkLGNz1k-cHXLt?usp=sharing).*

- **[Pixelate](https://github.com/Akhan521/Pixelate)**  
  Developed a **colorblind-friendly pixel-art editor** with an AI assistant (`Pixi`), real-time **colorblind-friendly** filters, and an accessible, intuitive interface for artists.  
  *View our demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Pixelate?tab=readme-ov-file#-pixelate-in-action).*

- **[Reddit Crawler](https://github.com/Akhan521/Reddit-Crawler)**  
  Engineered a robust **Reddit crawler and search engine** that **scraped, cleaned, and enriched 500MB+** of
  real-time subreddit data with **multi-threading** support, improving crawl throughput by 4× via parallelization.  
  *View our demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Reddit-Crawler?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-demo).*

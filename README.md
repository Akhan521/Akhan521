## Hi there, I'm Aamir Khan👋🏼

I’m a **Computer Science B.S. + M.S. student at UC Riverside** interested in **Machine Learning, Generative AI, building software, and engineering for good**. 

I enjoy exploring the intersection of **AI, engineering, and accessibility**, and I love turning ideas into fun and impactful projects.


### 👨🏽‍🎓 About Me
- **Aspiring AI & ML Engineer**: I focus on building and learning with **AI & ML** (LLMs, Gen. AI, Model Efficiency, etc.) 
- **Software Engineer**: I enjoy building **full-stack apps, intelligent tools, and friendly user experiences**.  
- **Engineering for Good**: My goal is to create projects that are technically impressive in addition to being **helpful and accessible to others**.  
- **Beyond Code**: I’m into **reading, building LEGO, going for coffee runs, and gaming**, which keep me curious and inspired.

### 🛠️ A Glimpse Into My Projects
- **[Text2SQL LLaMA Analyst](https://github.com/Akhan521/Text2SQL-LLaMA-Analyst)**  
  Fine-tuned `LLaMA-2-7B` to translate natural language into SQL queries using **LoRA + 4-bit quantization**.  
  *Includes a zero-setup [Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ISQ9jpYCEMQQ6WSKRqF60p3ZIEsJuuFo?usp=sharing)*

- **[GPT From Scratch](https://github.com/Akhan521/GPT-From-Scratch)**  
  Implemented **multi-head self-attention, transformer blocks, and autoregressive decoding** entirely from scratch in PyTorch to truly understand how GPT models work.  
  *Test it out yourself [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pHiw6OKHFPuaUIHw2aJkLGNz1k-cHXLt?usp=sharing).*

- **[Pixelate](https://github.com/Akhan521/Pixelate)**  
  A **colorblind-friendly pixel-art editor** with an AI assistant (`Pixi`), real-time **colorblind-friendly** filters, and an accessible, intuitive interface.  
  *View our demo [here](https://github.com/Akhan521/Pixelate?tab=readme-ov-file#-pixelate-in-action).*
